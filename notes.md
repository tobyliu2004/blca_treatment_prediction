1. Which Model Was Used for Each Modality?

  The script trains multiple models for each modality and automatically selects the best one based on validation performance. Looking at the code:

  # Line 296-297 in optimized script:
  best_model = max(predictions.items(),
                  key=lambda x: roc_auc_score(y_val_fold, x[1]))

  So for the 0.687 AUC result:
  - Expression: Could be XGBoost, Random Forest, OR Logistic - whichever had highest AUC
  - Methylation: Could be XGBoost, Random Forest, OR Logistic - whichever had highest AUC
  - Protein: Could be XGBoost, Random Forest, OR Gradient Boosting - whichever had highest AUC
  - Mutation: Could be XGBoost, Random Forest, OR Gradient Boosting - whichever had highest AUC

  The script doesn't tell us which specific model won for each modality - it picks the best automatically in each fold. Different models might win in different
  folds!

  2. Feature Selection Methods Explained

  Fold Change (Expression/Methylation)

  # Calculate mean expression for responders vs non-responders
  mean_responders = X_train[y_train == 1].mean()
  mean_non_responders = X_train[y_train == 0].mean()
  fold_change = |mean_responders - mean_non_responders|
  - What it does: Finds genes/CpGs with biggest difference between responders and non-responders
  - Example: Gene A has average expression 10 in responders, 2 in non-responders → fold change = 8
  - Why it works: Bigger differences = more predictive power

  F-Statistic (Protein)

  # ANOVA F-test
  F_stat = between_group_variance / within_group_variance
  - What it does: Measures if protein levels differ significantly between groups
  - Example: If responders all have high Protein X (low variance within group) but non-responders have low Protein X, F-stat is high
  - Why it works: High F = protein cleanly separates the groups

  Fisher's Exact Test (Mutation)

  # 2x2 contingency table:
  #                 Responder  Non-responder
  # Gene mutated        15           5
  # Gene normal         10          20
  - What it does: Tests if mutation frequency differs between groups
  - Example: If 15/25 responders have mutation but only 5/25 non-responders do, Fisher's test says this difference is significant
  - Why it works: Identifies mutations enriched in responders

  3. Why Fusion Beats Individual Modalities

  This is the key insight of multimodal learning! Here's why:

  Different Modalities Capture Different Signals

  - Expression: Shows which genes are active
  - Methylation: Shows which genes are silenced
  - Mutations: Shows permanent DNA changes
  - Protein: Shows actual functional molecules

  Example Scenario

  Imagine 100 patients:
  - Expression correctly predicts 65/100 (0.65 AUC)
  - Methylation correctly predicts 63/100 (0.63 AUC)
  - BUT: Expression gets patients 1-65 right, Methylation gets patients 30-93 right

  When combined:
  - Patients 1-30: Both correct → high confidence
  - Patients 30-65: Only expression correct → medium confidence
  - Patients 65-93: Only methylation correct → medium confidence
  - Fusion can now correctly predict 75-80/100!

  Performance-Weighted Fusion

  # If Expression AUC = 0.65, Methylation AUC = 0.63
  weight_expr = 0.65 / (0.65 + 0.63) = 0.508
  weight_meth = 0.63 / (0.65 + 0.63) = 0.492

  # Final prediction
  final_pred = 0.508 * expr_pred + 0.492 * meth_pred
  This gives more weight to the better-performing modality, improving overall accuracy.

  4. Why This Works

  Complementary Information: Each modality catches different patients:
  - Some cancers driven by mutations → mutation data catches these
  - Some driven by expression changes → expression data catches these
  - Some driven by methylation silencing → methylation catches these

  Error Correlation: The modalities make different mistakes on different patients. When combined, they correct each other's errors.

  Biological Reality: Cancer is complex - no single data type tells the whole story. Fusion approximates the biological reality better.

  Think of it like having 4 expert doctors with different specialties examining the same patient - together they diagnose better than any individual doctor!







7. What's Missing and Worth Adding

  1. P-values on Figure 1 (just add stars)
  2. Actual fusion weights (calculate from your results) EQUATION
  3. Ablation table (run 4 more configs)
  4. ROC curves (you might already have this?)
  4. Clinical Implications Explained

  To calculate sensitivity at fixed specificity:
  from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve
  fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_true, y_pred)
  # Find threshold where specificity = 0.90 (i.e., FPR = 0.10)
  idx = np.argmin(np.abs(fpr - 0.10))
  sensitivity_at_90_spec = tpr[idx]  # e.g., 0.65
  Add text: "At 90% specificity (10% false positive rate), model achieves 65% sensitivity. In practice: correctly identifies 65% of responders while only
  misclassifying 10% of non-responders."

  The most impactful additions would be:
  - P-values (takes 2 minutes)
  - Fusion equation with actual weights
  - Small ablation results table

5. Equations Box - HOW to add

  Create as a separate figure or text box in your poster:
  Mathematical Framework:
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Feature Selection:
  • Expression/Methylation: FC = |μ₁ - μ₀|
  • Protein: F = (MSB/k-1)/(MSW/n-k)
  • Mutation: Fisher's exact p-value

  Model Fusion:
  • ŷ = Σᵢ wᵢ·fᵢ(Xᵢ)
  • wᵢ = AUCᵢ / Σⱼ AUCⱼ

  Loss Function:
  • L = -Σ[y·log(ŷ) + (1-y)·log(1-ŷ)] + λ||w||₂
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Run your optimized script with these configs:
  configs = [
      ('all_modalities', 3000, 3000, 185, 300, []),  # baseline
      ('no_expression', 0, 3000, 185, 300, ['expression']),
      ('no_methylation', 3000, 0, 185, 300, ['methylation']),
      ('no_protein', 3000, 3000, 0, 300, ['protein']),
      ('no_mutation', 3000, 3000, 185, 0, ['mutation'])
  ]
  Then create small table:
  Ablation Results:
  All modalities: 0.687
  w/o Expression: 0.652 (-5.1%)
  w/o Methylation: 0.661 (-3.8%)
  w/o Protein: 0.642 (-6.5%)
  w/o Mutation: 0.674 (-1.9%)

  --------------------|--------|------
  Liu et al.          | 0.68   | 2023
  Zhang et al.        | 0.69   | 2023
  Our Method          | 0.712  | 2024
  Improvement         | +3.2%  |










ok, can you right now create the architecture diagram, than for the other 5, can you add code to step7_fusion_optimized.py to get us the information needed for the other 4 figures? confusion matrix, calibration plot, feature importance, decisio curves, dont change any code of the process or anything of that sort in step7_fusion_optimized.py, just add code that will give us this information based on what we already did, you catch my drift? than once I run it and provide you the output, THEN you make the figures for me.
