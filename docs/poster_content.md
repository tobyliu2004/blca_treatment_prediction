## Background/Introduction

**Why is this a problem:**
- Bladder cancer is the 6th most common cancer in the US with ~83,000 new cases annually
- Treatment response varies significantly among patients (30% non-response rate)
- Current clinical markers insufficient for accurate response prediction
- Need personalized treatment strategies based on molecular profiles

**Key points of literature review:**
- Multi-omics integration shows promise in cancer precision medicine
- Previous studies achieved 0.65-0.70 AUC using single modalities
- Late fusion approaches outperform early fusion in high-dimensional data
- Limited by small sample sizes in most genomic studies

---

## Purpose/Objectives/Hypothesis

**Objective**: Develop a multimodal machine learning framework to predict bladder cancer treatment response by integrating gene expression, DNA methylation, somatic mutations, and protein expression data.

**Hypothesis**: Late fusion of multiple genomic modalities will achieve superior predictive performance (target AUC > 0.75) compared to individual modalities by capturing complementary biological signals.

## Methods

**Study Design**:
- 227 bladder cancer patients (159 responders, 68 non-responders)
- 80/20 train-test split with 5-fold cross-validation
- Class-weighted training to handle imbalance

**Data Sources**:
- Expression: RNA-seq (20,653 genes)
- Methylation: 450k array (495K CpGs)
- Mutation: Somatic variants (20,530 genes)
- Protein: RPPA (245 proteins)

**Preprocessing Pipeline**:
1. **Expression**: Zero filter (>80%), variance filter (top 95%), Z-score normalization
2. **Methylation**: Missing value filter (>20%), variance filter (top 10%), KNN imputation
3. **Mutation**: Frequency filter (≥3% general, ≥1% known genes), pathway aggregation
4. **Protein**: Missing filter (>25%), median imputation, variance filter

**Feature Selection** (Inside CV):
- Expression/Methylation: Fold change ranking
- Protein: F-statistic (ANOVA)
- Mutation: Fisher's exact test

**Models**:
- High-dimensional: XGBoost, Random Forest, SGDClassifier
- Low-dimensional: CatBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting

**Fusion**: Performance-weighted averaging of modality predictions

2. **modality_performance_bar.png** - Bar chart of individual AUCs
3. **fusion_comparison.png** - Comparison of fusion configurations
4. **model_architecture.png** - Visual representation of the pipeline

**Key Results:**
- Best fusion model: **0.705 ± 0.080 AUC** (weighted average, high_features config)
- Individual modalities:
  - Protein: 0.662 ± 0.074 AUC
  - Expression: 0.646 ± 0.080 AUC
  - Methylation: 0.629 ± 0.075 AUC
  - Mutation: 0.610 ± 0.040 AUC
- Optimal features: 3000 expression, 3000 methylation, 185 protein, 300 mutation

## Results/Implications

**Summary results:**
- Late fusion improved performance by 6.4% over best individual modality
- Performance-weighted averaging outperformed simple averaging
- Model limited by sample size rather than methodology

**Significance of results/implications:**
- Demonstrates value of multimodal integration in precision oncology
- Identifies protein expression as most predictive individual modality
- Simple, interpretable methods competitive with complex approaches
- Framework applicable to other cancer types and treatment decisions

## Future Actions

**Any follow-up action:**
- Validate on external cohort (target n>500)
- Incorporate clinical variables (stage, grade, demographics)
- Add copy number and structural variant data
- Explore deep learning architectures with larger sample size
- Develop web-based prediction tool for clinical use
- Investigate biological mechanisms of predictive features
