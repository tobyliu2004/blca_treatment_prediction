## Available Figures

All figures are saved in the `poster_figures/` directory:

1. **comprehensive_summary.png** - A complete overview figure that could serve as the main visual element of your poster. It includes:
   - Patient distribution pie chart
   - Data modality overview
   - Feature selection impact
   - Individual modality performance
   - Main ROC curves comparing fusion vs best individual
   - Fusion configuration comparison
   - Key findings and clinical impact boxes

2. **individual_modality_roc.png** - ROC curves for each individual modality (Protein, Expression, Methylation, Mutation) showing their individual predictive performance

3. **modality_performance_bar.png** - Bar chart comparing AUC scores across all four modalities with error bars

4. **fusion_comparison.png** - Detailed comparison of different fusion configurations showing simple average vs weighted average performance

5. **feature_selection_analysis.png** - Four-panel figure showing:
   - Expression features vs performance
   - Methylation features vs performance  
   - Mutation features vs performance
   - Fusion weights pie chart

6. **model_architecture.png** - Visual diagram of the entire multimodal late fusion pipeline from raw data to final prediction

## Poster Content

The file `poster_content.md` contains all the text content organized by poster sections:
- Title and authors
- Background/Introduction
- Purpose/Objectives/Hypothesis
- Methods
- Results
- Results/Implications
- Future Actions
- Acknowledgments
- References

## How to Use These Materials

1. **For the main results section**: Use the comprehensive_summary.png as it provides a complete overview of your findings

2. **For methods visualization**: Use model_architecture.png to show your pipeline

3. **For detailed results**: Choose from the individual figures based on space:
   - If you have room for multiple figures, use individual_modality_roc.png and fusion_comparison.png
   - If space is limited, the comprehensive_summary.png contains the key information

4. **Text content**: Copy the relevant sections from poster_content.md and adjust based on your poster template's space constraints

## Key Highlights to Emphasize

- **Main Result**: 70.5% AUC using multimodal late fusion
- **Innovation**: Performance-weighted fusion strategy
- **Clinical Impact**: Potential to improve treatment selection
- **Technical Achievement**: Proper validation preventing data leakage

Good luck with your poster presentation!
