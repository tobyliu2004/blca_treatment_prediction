FIGURE CORRECTIONS NEEDED
========================

Based on verification script results:

Figure 1: Individual Modality Performance
- CORRECT AS IS (matches step6 and step7 outputs)

Figure 2: Fusion Configuration Performance  
- CORRECT AS IS (matches optimized_results.json)

Figure 3: Data Preprocessing Funnel
- Need to update methylation original size from 495,000 to 485,577
- Expression original should be 20,530 (not 20,653)
- Mutation original should be 40,543 (not 20,530)

Figure 4: Expression Comparison
- Preprocessed expression should be 0.653 (not 0.651)
- This is from expression_comparison_results, not step6

Figure 5: ROC Curves
- CORRECT AS IS (uses Protein 0.633 and Fusion 0.705)

Figure 6: Model Performance Heatmap
- CORRECT AS IS (shows XGBoost best results)

Figure 7: Mutation Pathway Network
- PATHWAYS found in code, genes match
- 5 pathways: RTK_RAS, PI3K_AKT, Cell_Cycle_TP53, Chromatin_Remodeling, DNA_Repair
- Note: In code it's "Cell_Cycle_TP53" not just "Cell_Cycle"

Figure 8: Feature Selection Comparison
- CORRECT AS IS (shows reasonable comparative values)

Figure 9: Cross-Validation Methodology
- CORRECT AS IS (no numbers, just process)

Figure 10: Clinical Impact
- CORRECT AS IS (based on 227 patients, 0.705 AUC)

SUMMARY OF CHANGES NEEDED:
1. Figure 3: Update original data sizes
2. Figure 4: Change preprocessed expression from 0.651 to 0.653
3. Figure 7: Update pathway name from "Cell Cycle" to "Cell Cycle/TP53"
